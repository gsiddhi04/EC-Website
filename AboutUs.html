  <p class="para">The Election Commission (EC) at IIT Kanpur was established to ensure the democratic spirit and
    fairness in the election processes within the Students' Gymkhana. The Students' Gymkhana, founded in 1962, serves as
    the student government organization aimed at cultivating leadership qualities and promoting the general welfare of
    the student body.
    The primary role of the EC is to conduct free and fair elections, adhering to the norms and Model Code of Conduct of
    the Students' Gymkhana.</p>

    heard and valued through the power of their vote. We envision a campus where high voter turnout reflects a united
    and proactive student body, capable of influencing university decisions and policies effectively. By fostering a
    culture of democratic participation, we aim to develop future leaders who understand the significance of governance
    and are dedicated to advocating for the interests and well-being of their peers.</p>
  <div class="mission">Mission of Election Commission</div>

    spirit within the Students’ Gymkhana. Our mission is to ensure that the process of electing student representatives
    is conducted freely and fairly, upholding the principles of transparency, integrity, and inclusivity. By doing so,
    we empower students to actively participate in self-governance, shaping the policies and decisions that affect their
    daily lives on campus.</p>
